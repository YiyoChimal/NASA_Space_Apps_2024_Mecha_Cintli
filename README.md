## Problem
Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making

## About
The project was addressed with a Sensor module (Shield Root) and a transmitter-emitter module (Shield Root Collector) along with real-time weather data and other data processed by the API, will provide the user with alerts, recommendations, and access to sensor information through a mobile app (Crop Shield).

## Information
