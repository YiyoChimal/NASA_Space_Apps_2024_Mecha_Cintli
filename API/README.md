üõ†Ô∏è Possible Improvements and Suggestions

    Integration with a Real Database:
        Current: Data is stored in a CSV file.
        Suggestion: Migrate to a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite for scalability and security.
        Advantages:
            Faster and more efficient queries.
            Enhanced data management.

    Advanced Error Handling:
        Add validation and error handling layers to improve API stability.

    Authentication and Authorization:
        Implement a more robust system using JWT or OAuth for enhanced security.

    Rate Limiting:
        Limit request rates to prevent system abuse.

    Documentation and Testing:
        Add unit tests using frameworks like pytest.
        Create comprehensive documentation with tools like Swagger.
